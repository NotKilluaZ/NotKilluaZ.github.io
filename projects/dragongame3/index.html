You have heard rumors that the oldest, most valuable treasure is a sword hidden deep within the Abyss, guarded by many monsters and even <em><strong>Dragons!</strong></em> Being the curious explorer you are, you decide to seek out this treasure...

You realize that the rest of your treasure hunting journey is dependent completely on luck, and whether you choose to follow the correct spirit. Based on maps of the Abyss you are aware that only one of these spirits will lead you to the treasure, and that the others will lead to your certain <em><strong>doom!</strong></em> The time has come to pick a spirit:</span>
