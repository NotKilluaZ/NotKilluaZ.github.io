        <h3 class='subTitle'>University</h3>
        <p>Recently, I enrolled in full-time studies at the University of Waterloo! This has been my dream school since middle school, and I am thrilled to be offered the opportunity to study my first choice program, Software Engineering. The next step in my academic journey to land an internship at a large tech company such as Google, Amazon, Apple, or OpenAI. If I could choose anywhere to work, however, I would choose something related to artificial intelligence as my overall goal with this degree in SE is to specialize in the AI industry. I wish to innovate and develop ground-breaking AI software that had a major impact on the modern world.</p>

        <h3 class='subTitle'>Travel To Japan</h3>
        <p>Although my number one goal right now is my school life, something I have always wanted to do on the side is visit Japan with a group of friends. I have gone on more family vactions to Hawaii than I can count, but I have never experiences any part of Asia or Europe. At some point, I will hope to have visited both of these beautiful continents but my main focus is Japan, Asia. I chose Japan as a dream destination over my other interests such as South Korea or Hong Kong for numerous reasons. Firstly, the food is one thing I have always wanted to try straight from Japan, especially their street foods such as Takoyaki from Osaka. Secondly, they are home to many exotic goods from companies that I love such as Yonex, Muji, Copic, and Uni, which would allow me to fill my pockets with all the toys, souviners, candy, or other items that I could think of. Lastly, I have always wanted to see the famous locations scattered throughout the country that from images online. Places like Akihabara, the Tokyo Tower, Gion in Kyoto, Arashiyama Bamboo Grove, Fushimi Inari Shrine, Dotombori in Osaka, and particularly the Shibuya Crossing. Currently, I plan on travelling to Japan either in the spring season of my 12th grade year because of the blooming of Japan's cherry blossoms, or the summer season following my graduation as it will be the only period my friends and I are available.</p>

        <h3 class='subTitle'>Career Plans</h3>
        <p>Ideally, my future career would be working for a large tech company such as Google, Instagram, Twitter, Apple, or Microsoft. I would like to solve different problems for different projects of tasks using my programming abilities and skills. The reason this field of work interests me is because I have learned from working in a restaurant, that I get extremely bored of doing the same routine over and over again. By being able to work on different projects, I can stop this repetitive and tiring feeling. Additionally, I also find satisfaction in solving problems, and knowing that computer science is all about problem solving, this career path entices me even more. I think that any tech related job in today's world is also another reason to choose this field. As the world grows more connected and reliant on technology, having a job that relates to that is a solid asset since there is an ever growing demand for tech positions. Something that does create contending loyalties for me however, is the fact that I would preferably choose to work and live somewhere in Canada such as Vancouver that is also close to my home in Calgary, Alberta. However, this conflicts with the fact that because I would love to work for a large tech company, the majority of these positions reside in the United States, meaning that I would most likely have to move south in order to pursure this dream.</p>

        <h3 class='subTitle'>Extra Skills</h3>
        <p>Another aspect in my life that I value is picking up a wide variety of skills through hobbies or activities. Some skills I have already gathered in my life are my artistic abilites (most noticeably in drawing), skiing and snowboarding skills, as well as a cook in a resturaunt. Currently, I am working on devloping my computer science abilites, badminton skill, as well as my prowess as a leader. Methods in which I am working towards achieving these include producing side projects for computer science (such as this website!) as well as joining the Badminton Club. The skills I am improving right now that I am most passionate about are my computer sceience and mathematic ones, but perhaps the largest one is video editting. I usually work towards devloping this skill through playing with Adobe Premiere Pro and my video game clips.</p>
